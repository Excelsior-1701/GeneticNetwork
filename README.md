# Genetic Polynomial Solver

Had an annoying issue when I was playing SS13 a while back trying to optimize BZ formation. Complex functions like this are kind of annoying to solve mathematically, but fortunately polynomials like this are easy to optimize with genetic algos because the curves are all nice and smooth.
